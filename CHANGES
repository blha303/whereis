v2.3
Implemented multi-world support, on request from lochlain on mcaddictgallery.info.
It's the same multi-world setup I used on PlacePay. Maybe buggy, but I'm sure server owners can work around it.

v2.2
Changed colours on the location messages. Now if a player is op, the red op colour won't reset the rest of the message to white.
(For some reason, Eclipse thinks 'colour' is spelt wrong. Nooooope. I'm right.)
World names are also in red now.
Modified 'permission denied' message slightly to tell the console that someone was denied access to the command.

v2.1
'/whereis' on its own now shows version number as well as usage info.

v2.0
Now has permission node (whereis.allow) and therefore requires Vault. Players have this node by default.
Now shows what world a player is in, if they're in a different world. (player command only)

v1.1
Recompiled in Java 6. Is now compatible with 6/7.

v1.0
/whereis PLAYERNAME returns their coordinates
No restrictions as yet. Permissions will be in the next full release.
Not multi-world. This will also be in the next full release.
