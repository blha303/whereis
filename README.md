# WhereIs

A plugin that shows a player's in-game coordinates. Can be used from either the console, or by any in-game player. 
**Now supports permissions!** 
**Now supports multiple worlds!!** 
**NOW THE MESSAGE IS GREEN!!!!**
White text usually looks like chat messages, so I made the coords response green.
